### Package Guidelines

- **`cmd/`**: CLI-specific code, keep minimal
- **`internal/`**: Private packages, core business logic
- **`pkg/`**: Public packages that external users can import
- **`examples/`**: Working examples and tutorials

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start Working on an Issue

```bash
# Make sure you're on the main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Changes

Follow these guidelines:
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow the existing code style

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run linting
make lint

# Build and test manually
make build
./mongork --help

# Test with real MongoDB (if applicable)
./mongork status
```

### 4. Commit Changes

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add new migration rollback functionality

- Add rollback command to CLI
- Implement down migration logic
- Add comprehensive tests
- Update documentation

Fixes #123"
```

#### Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor:` code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test:` adding missing tests
- `chore:` changes to build process, dependencies, etc.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
go test ./internal/...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./internal/...

# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Start MongoDB for testing
docker run --name mongo-test -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:7

# Run integration tests
go test -tags integration ./...

# Clean up
docker stop mongo-test && docker rm mongo-test
```

### Test Structure

### Writing Good Tests

- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Test both success and error cases
- Use meaningful test names
- Keep tests focused and independent
- Use test helpers for common setup

## Code Style

### Guidelines

- Use `gofmt` and `goimports`
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Add comments for exported functions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Handle errors properly
- Use context for cancellation

### Linting

```bash
   # Run the linter
   make lint
   
   # Or directly with golangci-lint
   golangci-lint run
   
   # Auto-fix some issues
   golangci-lint run --fix
```

## Release Process

### Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Workflow

1. **Create Release Branch**:

```bash
  git checkout -b release/v0.1.0
```

2. **Update Version Files**:
   - Update version in `cmd/mongork/version.go`
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test Release**:
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   make build-all
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**: Target the main branch

5. **Tag Release** (maintainers only):

```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
   git push origin v1.2.0
```

6. **GitHub Actions** will automatically:
   - Build binaries for all platforms
   - Create GitHub release
   - Build and push Docker images
   - Update Homebrew formula

### Manual Homebrew Update (if needed)

If the Homebrew formula does not update automatically, you can update it by hand:

1. Open the tap repo: `https://github.com/drewjocham/homebrew-mongork`
2. Update the formula file (typically `Formula/mongork.rb`) with:
   - The new version
   - The release asset URLs
   - The SHA256 for each asset (download the assets and run `shasum -a 256 <file>`)
3. Commit and push the tap repo changes.

Users can then run:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade mongork
```

### Changelog Format

```markdown
